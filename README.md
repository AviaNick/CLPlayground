# CLPlayground
A Repository where I play around with Common Lisp and other Lisp Dialects to prepare for some of my other project which I wish to do in a Lisp dialect.

# Projects I've done in the Repository
Common Lisp Chatbot - A Simple Chatbot in CL\
Scheme Chatbot - A Simple Chatbot in Scheme  

# Lisp Projects I'm planning to do
Compiler for Scheme (Probably Written in C)
