# Basic Chatbot written in (Common) Lisp
The code can be found here: http://tpcg.io/wp5TbqNB.  
This code is not on https://replit.com because they don't have Common Lisp Support\
Instead I have hosted it on https://www.tutorialspoint.com/  
I know it isn't great BUT it's better than having you download the code and then do some copy-pasta into an online compiler such as https://rextester.com/l/common_lisp_online_compiler. Which you can still do... If you have all the time in the world...
